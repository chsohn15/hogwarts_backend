## The Harry Potter Writing App

This app is designed to engage students in writing by providing an immersive experience into the Harry Potter world. New student users can take a sorting hat quiz to determine their Hogwarts house, select an alter ego from that house, view their teacher's announcements, and complete writing assignments. Teacher users can view their students, make announcements to their classes, and give feedback and grades on student assignments.
